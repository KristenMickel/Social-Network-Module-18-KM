## Description
For this assignment, we were tasked with creating endpoints for a social networking site that allows users to add thoughts and comment on the thoughts of their friends. We used MongoDB for the database with the Mongoose ODM, as well as, Express.js and Node.js for the server. We were tasked with creating the following enpoints:one to retrieve all d users, one to retrieve a specific user by ID, one to create a new user, one to change a user, one to delete a user, one to add a new friend to a user, one to delete a friend from a user, one to get all thoughts, one to get a single thought by its ID, one to create a new thought, one to change a thought, one to delete a thought, one to create a reaction to a thought, and one to remove a reaction from a thought. MongoDB is a good fit for building this type of application given that it is a general purpose NoSQL database that uses documents to store data. It works well with JavaScript because it stores data in objects in a format called BSON, or Binary JSON. BSON looks and acts like JSON but is optimized for faster parsing. Groups of documents are stored in collections (which is the equivalent of SQL tables). Collections do not have an enforced schema to limit the type of data stored. Each document in a collection can have different fields (keys) and can contain different types of data. Related data can be stored in embedded documents. Unlike SQL, related data in MongoDB is not split between tables. Instead, related data is nested within a single object as an embedded document. I was not able to get my routes to successfully work because I had difficulty seeding my database. In my video, I demonstrate how I could test my routes, but I was not able to successfully retrieve or change my data.
